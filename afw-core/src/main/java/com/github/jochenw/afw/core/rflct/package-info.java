/** This package contains a set of interfaces, and implementations,
 * which are intended to replace Java reflection with
 * {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle method handles}. By using
 * these interfaces, and implementations, you gain the possibilities,
 * that Java reflection provides, in a manner, which is agnostic of
 * JVM versions.
 * These interfaces, and implementations are:
 * <table>
 *   <tr><th>Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@link IInstantiator}</td><td>Object creation</td></tr>
